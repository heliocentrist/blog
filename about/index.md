## Hello and welcome!

I'm [Yury Liavitski](https://twitter.com/Heliocene).

I'm a software developer and a data engineer. My favourite area of work is the fast data space, I enjoy setting up data pipelines and streaming services. If I can help you with similar projects by working with you or just by answering a question, please do not hesitate to contact me at yury.liavitski@kemia.org .

I love studying distributed systems, functional programming, and recently I'm obsessed with a new systems programming language called [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). I've started a [blog](https://theelderscripts.com) to help me organise my study notes. When I study a topic I find that it's useful to code a small project in that area. I have a [Github account](https://github.com/heliocentrist) where I store these projects.

In the past I have worked in various companies, from an investment bank to a loyalty program supplier. It's been around 13 years since I've started coding professionally, so I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuryliavitski/) to help me remember where I used to work.

I live in a small beautiful town called Haarlem, in the Netherlands. Next to programming the things I love are history, archeology and travelling across Europe taking photos of castles and churches.

Thanks for visiting my site!
